Comparison:
Overall, Best First Search is lightweight and can be faster when approximate solutions are sufficient, but it sacrifices path quality for speed. A*, in contrast, guarantees optimality at the cost of higher time and memory usage. From a performance perspective, Best First Search is better suited for quick approximations in large problems, while A* is preferred for scenarios where the shortest path is critical, such as navigation, robotics, and AI-based planning. The choice between the two depends on whether the application prioritizes efficiency or accuracy: Best First Search favors performance speed, whereas A* ensures correctness even if it takes longer.
